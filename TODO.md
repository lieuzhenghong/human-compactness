# TODO

1. Write a function that builds the Euclidean distance tractwise matrix
2. Calculate human compactness function currently needs 
tract_to_district mapping for Euclidean distance, but 
doesn't need it for driving duration. This is because

3. Figure out why euclidean distances are giving us completely wacko values
- because we are not actually generating the pointwise sum matrix,
we are reading it in 12_Process_Ensembles
